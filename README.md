# Connect Four Game 🔴🟡

A fully functional web-based implementation of the classic **Connect Four** strategy game, built entirely with **ASP.NET Core Blazor**. This project demonstrates how to handle complex game logic, 2D arrays, and interactive UI state using **C#** instead of JavaScript.

## 🚀 Features

* **Classic Gameplay:** Two-player local mode (Red vs. Yellow).
* **Interactive Board:** Click on any column to drop a piece into the lowest available slot.
* **Game Logic:** Robust C# algorithms to detect win conditions (Vertical, Horizontal, and Diagonal).
* **Dynamic UI:** The board updates instantly using Blazor's state management.
* **Responsive Design:** Styled with CSS to mimic the look and feel of a physical game board.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Concepts

* **Framework:** ASP.NET Core Blazor
* **Language:** C#
* **Game State:** Managing a 2D array (`board[7,6]`) to track piece positions.
* **Logic:** Algorithms for checking "4-in-a-row" in all directions.
* **Styling:** Custom CSS to create the board grid, circular slots, and animation effects.
