# Connect Four Game 🎮

A web-based implementation of the classic **Connect Four** strategy game, built entirely with **ASP.NET Core Blazor** and **C#**. This project demonstrates how to handle complex game logic, state management, and CSS animations within the .NET ecosystem.

## 🚀 Features

* **Interactive Gameplay:** Two-player logic where users take turns dropping pieces into the board.
* **Custom Design:** Styled with a vibrant **Green** vs. **Purple** color scheme using CSS.
* **Win Detection Algorithm:** Robust logic to automatically detect a win in all directions:
    * Horizontal ➖
    * Vertical ❘
    * Diagonal (both ways) ❌
* **State Management:** Tracks whose turn it is and prevents further moves once a winner is declared.
* **Reset Functionality:** Ability to restart the game instantly without reloading the page.
